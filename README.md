# Code Fragments extension for Visual Studio Code

With this extension you can save static code fragments for later use, and easily insert them into source files whenever needed.

## Features

After installing the extension, a new section called "CODE FRAGMENTS" is added to the Explorer, which shows a list of the previously saved fragments. Clicking on one inserts its content into the current editor at the cursor position.

You can save a piece of code by selecting it in the editor, and then executing the "Save selection as Code Fragment" from the Command Palette (brought up with `Ctrl+Shift+P`) or in the context menu.
